Obviously, you master this version, and you also follow the novelties and evolutions of more recent ones Besides, we are talking about Java ... But the Spring ecosystem is part of your daily life. Even though Java and Spring are similar, your expert eye knows how to tell them apart! A big + if you know that Spring is based on Proxies! We don't teach you anything if we tell you that Hibernate is a go-to ORM. Although, essential? Truly ? Not so sure ! You are aware that business constraints can lead you to start with NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Neo4j ...) You stay open ... Even if your heart is inclined towards Spring, your vigil prompts you to take an interest in Quarkus or Micronaut. Finally, for you, the job of a developer also means staying connected to your environment and to other professions in the system. You are familiar with REST, Microservices and Containerization architecture."
